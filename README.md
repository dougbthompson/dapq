##  Background -
Research into implementing a "distributed" queue management control module.

Centralized queue management works well for smaller and well behaved queue requests, but performance degrades and becomes inefficient when the two variables of (number of devices to manage) or (complexity of requests) overwhelms a centralized queue manager to know the state of all devices simultaneously.
